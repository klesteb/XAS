XAS v0.07

XAS is middleware for Perl. It provides standardized methods, modules
and philosophy for constructing large distributed applications. This 
system is based on production code that has been running for over five 
years without any problems.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    # perl Build.PL
    # ./Build
    # ./Build test
    # ./Build install
    # ./Build post_install

On a Linux system this will install the software into /usr/local. This can
be overridden with the --install_base option to Build.PL. 

You can also use the Debian package manager to install this software. Use the
following commands to do so:

    # debuild -uc -us
    # dpkg -i ../libxas-base-perl_0.05-1_all.deb

If you are RPM based then a spec file has been included. If you have a
rpm build environment then you can do the following:

   # rpmbuild -ta xas-0.07.tar.gz
   # yum localinstall perl-XAS-0.07-1.noarch.rpm

The above will install the software into /usr/local. This package uses CPAN
modules that may not be supported from debian/rpm repositories.  

WARNING

    These installation instructions presupposes some sort of Linux box.
    Persumably a Debian based distribution. The perl based installation
    steps will work on Redhat based distributions. They will also work,
    to a certain extent, on generic Unix based systems. With these, the 
    specialized startup scripts will need to be modified to work on them.
    This software requires Perl 5.8.8 or higher to operate.

POST INSTALLATION

This installation also creates a "xas" user and group. This is used to
set permissions on files and for user context with running daemons.

A xas.sh file is created and placed in the /etc/profile.d directory to define 
environment variables for the system. 

A xas file is created and placed in the /etc/logrotate.d directory to
help manage log files.

Start up scripts for various daemons are created in /etc/init.d. Since the 
LSB is rather liberally interrupted by the various distributors, these scripts 
are for Debian based systems. Porting them to other distributions is rather
trivial and if you have a fool proof way to determine the Linux distribution,
please forward it to me. Thanks.

This system uses a Message Queue. This queue needs to be STOMP 1.0 compatible.
RabbitMQ and POE::Component::MessageQueue have been tested. 

This system uses a database. The default install assumes PostgreSQL.
It has been tested with SQLite. You need to run /opt/xas/bin/create_db.pl 
to create a schema for the database. Once the schema is loaded you may
need to modify /opt/xas/etc/database.ini to reflect your database
environment.
