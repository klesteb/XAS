XAS v0.07

XAS is middleware for Perl. It provides standardized methods, modules
and philosophy for constructing large distributed applications. This 
system is based on production level code.

INSTALLATION

On Unix like systems, run the following commands:

    # perl Build.PL installdirs=site
    # ./Build
    # ./Build test
    # ./Build install
    # ./Build post_install

If you are DEB based, then debian build files has been provided.
If you have a debian build environment, then you can do the following:

    # debuild -uc -us
    # dpkg -i ../libxas-perl_0.07-1_all.deb

If you are RPM based, then a spec file has been included. If you have a
rpm build environment, then you can do the following:

    # rpmbuild -ta xas-0.07.tar.gz
    # yum localinstall perl-XAS-0.07-1.noarch.rpm

This will install the software into /usr/local and overlay /var. 

On Windows, do the following:

    > perl Build.PL
    > Build
    > Build test
    > Build install
    > Build post_install

This will create the directory structure C:\xas. To change this, set the
XAS_ROOT environment variable to something else. This variable should
also be set at the system level. It is recommended that you use Strawberry
Perl, ActiveState Perl doesn't have all of the necessary modules available.

WARNING

    Not all of the Perl modules have been included to make the software 
    run. You may need to load additional CPAN modules. How you do this,
    is dependent on how you manage your systems. This software requires 
    Perl 5.8.8 or higher to operate.

POST INSTALLATION

On Unix like systems, this installation also creates a "xas" user and group.
This is used to set permissions on files and for user context when running 
daemons. A xas.sh file is placed in the /etc/profile.d directory to define 
environment variables for the XAS system. 

On Windows, a xas.bat file is placed in %XAS_ROOT%/etc. This defines the
environment variables for the XAS system. They are not set at the system
level. You may wish to do so.

In either environment, if your network name resolution is slow, you
may want to define the XAS_HOSTNAME and XAS_DOMAIN environment variables. 
This will speed up start times considerably. 

This software requires a STOMP compatible message queue server. If it is
not running on the local host, then you will need to define the XAS_MQSERVER
environment variable to point to it. If it is not listening on the
default port, then you need to define the XAS_MQPORT environment
variable. The default STOMP protocol level is v1.0. If you want to change
this, you need to set the XAS_MQLEVEL environment variable. The XAS
system supports v1.0, v1.1 and v1.2.

This software also requires a SMTP based mail server. How mail is sent is defined
by the XAS_MXMAILER environment variable.

On Unix like systems, this is 'sendmail'. Your system will need a "sendmail"
compatible command. Which most mail systems provide.

On Windows this is 'smtp'. If the mail server is not running on the local host, then
you will need to define the XAS_MXSERVER environment variable to point to it. If
it is not listening on the default port, then you need to define the XAS_MXPORT
environment variable.
