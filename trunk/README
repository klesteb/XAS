XAS v0.07

XAS is middleware for Perl. It provides standardized methods, modules
and philosophy for constructing large distributed applications. This 
system is based on production level code.

INSTALLATION

On Unix like systems, run the following commands:

    # perl Build.PL installdirs=site
    # ./Build
    # ./Build test
    # ./Build install
    # ./Build post_install

This will install the software into /usr/local and /var. 

If you are DEB based, then a debian build files has been provided.
If you have a debian build environment, then you can do the following:

    # debuild -uc -us
    # dpkg -i ../libxas-perl_0.07-1_all.deb

If you are RPM based, then a spec file has been included. If you have a
rpm build environment then you can do the following:

    # rpmbuild -ta xas-0.07.tar.gz
    # yum localinstall perl-XAS-0.07-1.noarch.rpm

On Windows systems, do the following:

    $ perl Build.PL
    $ Build
    $ Build test
    $ Build install
    $ Build post_install

This wil create the directory structure C:\xas. To change this, set the
XAS_ROOT environment variable to something else. This varaible should
also be set at the system level so it survives reboots. It is recommeded
that you use Strawberry Perl, ActiveState Perl dosen't have all of the
necessary modules available.

WARNING

    Not all of the Perl modules have been included to make the software 
    run. You may need to load additional modules. How you do this, is
    dependent on how you manage your systems. This software requires 
    Perl 5.8.2 or higher to operate.

POST INSTALLATION

On Unix like systems, this installation also creates a "xas" user and group.
This is used to set permissions on files and for user context when running 
daemons. A xas.sh file is placed in the /etc/profile.d directory to define 
environment variables for the XAS system. 

On Windows, a xas.bat file is placed in %XAS_ROOT%/etc. This defines the
environment variables for the XAS system. They are not set at the system
level. You may wish to do so.

In either environment, if your network name resolution is slow, you
may want to define the XAS_HOST and XAS_DOMAIN variables. This will
speed up start times considerably.

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, you can find documentation for this module with the
perldoc command.
