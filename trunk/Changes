0.07    30-May-2014 Kevin L. Esteb
        Due to problems with releasing 0.06. I rethought how code would 
          be distributed. This lead to breaking everything up
          into smaller chunks for easier maintenance. This also lead to a
          rewrite and simplification of the code base itself.
        Now using git as the source repository. It seems to be what the
          "cool kids" are using.
