XAS::Docs::StyleGuide - How to write new code

=head1 STYLE

All programmers develop a style for their code. It has been suggested that
this style can even be used to determine who contributed what, for any given
project. Interesting if true. 

Code should be easy to read and have a nice flow, some would say it should be
elegant. Any programmer should be able to sit down and figure out what it 
does in a relatively short time. This means all those nice Perl tricks should 
be kept to a minimum. Remember you may not be the only person that needs to 
read and understand your code.

The style that I prefer has been developed over the past 25 years. It has been 
successfully used with different languages and environments. I first started 
using it with BASICPLUS 2 on the PDP 11/70 running RSTS/E. Yeah, I have been 
around that long.

=head1 WHITE SPACE

White space is your friend. It is there to help you read the code. Compilers 
and interpreters don't care about white space, you should. I find the following
code hard to read.

    if($something==$this){
        do_this();
    }

A more condensed version would be like this.

    if($something==$this){do_this();}

or

    do_this()if($something==$this);

or that BASICPLUS 2

    10 if something = this then \
           call do_this         \
       end if
 
or the more condensed version

    10 if something = this then:call do_this:end if

or the really condensed version

    10 call do_this if something = this

Perfectly valid code for the compiler, but extremely hard for the programmer to
read. I find this much easier to read.

    if ($something == $this) {
        
        do_this();
        
    }

Which leads into the next topic.

=head1 BRACING

There are many ways to do bracing. Most of it originated in the C world and
migrated to other environments. I prefer the bracing on the same line as the 
statement with the trailing brace in the starting column of that block. Here 
are some examples.

    while ($this != $done) {
        
    }

or

    do {
       
    } while ($this == $running);

or

    foreach my $a (@array) {
      
    }

or

    if ($something == $that) {
        
    } elsif {
        
    } else {
        
    }

or even this

    {
        # some additional code here
    }

Notice how I like to but parens around the conditional for the if 
statements. To me, it is easier to read.

=head1 INDENTION

Indenting code makes for readable code. This is a good thing. Just ask the
Python guys. Indents should be 4 spaces. I know that some people think 
this should be handled as tabs. With the terminals tab spacing set to whatever,
so the code lines up nicely. That may have been true when the Teletype 33 was 
dying and the vt100 was king. But with modern terminal emulators, fancy 
IDE editors, and web based pretty printers, the tab spacing just never matches
up. Especially when two people are using both styles in the same file. 

=head1 FORMATTING

With the usage of white space and indention, you can have fairly readable code.
For example a subroutine would be written like this.

    sub routine {
        my $p1 = shift;
        my $p2 = shift;
        
        if ($p1 == $p2) {
            
            do_something();
            
        }
        
    }

Which is straight forward and easy on the eyes. 

=head1 LINE WRAPPING

As everyone knows, god created the 80 by 24 character terminal and you
shall use it. I don't care if you have a 32" monitor and want to run your IDE 
in full screen mode. Line wrap will happen at character 75, unless the line 
makes sense going farther. 

=head1 VARIABLE NAMES

Variable names should make sense. A one character variable name makes sense
when used as an incremental. They should be lowercase and use "_" to denote
meaning. No L<CamelCase|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase> or 
L<Hungarian Notation|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation> here. 
Variables should be declared at the beginning of the routine unless there 
scope needs to be limited. For example.

    sub routine {
        my $p1 = shift;

        for (my $x = 0; $x < $p1; $x++) {
            
            do_something($x);
            
        }
        
    }
    
There is no need to declare $x for the entire routine, as it is the increment
for the loop.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

Remember that 80 by 24 terminal. Size matters. Your subroutine should fit 
within a terminal screen. If bigger, consider breaking it up.  

=head2 SUBROUTINE NAMES

Function, method, subroutine or whatever you call them, should be lowercase 
and use "_" to denote meaning. Once again, no L<CamelCase|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase> here. 

A leading "_" indicates a private method. Due to the nature of Perl. It is 
not easy to truly have private methods. If somebody abuses your code and 
uses your private methods, including me. It is their problem, should they 
get bitten by code changes. 

If you really thing you need them, may I suggest C#. It is a nice little 
bondage language, that will let you do all that Computer Science stuff, that 
your professors thought were important. Hey, it would might even run on Linux...

=head2 PARAMETERS

If you pass parameters to your subroutines, they should be validated if they
are a public interface. A validation method is supplied and uses 
L<Params::Validate|https://metacpan.org/pod/Params::Validate> as the validation
 engine. If more the two parameters are passed they need to be named and the 
parameter name must start with a "-". For example:

    package Package;

    our $VERSION = '0.01';

    use XAS::Class
        debug   => 0,
        version => $VERSION,
        base    => 'XAS::Base',
        utils   => ':validation',
    ;

    sub routine {
        my $self = shift;
        my ($p1, $p2) = validate_params(\@_, [1,1]);

    }

or with named parameters

    sub routine {
        my $self = shift;
        my $p = validate_params(\@_, {
            -p1 => 1,
            -p2 => 1,
        });

        my $p1 = $p->{p1};
        my $p2 = $p->{p2};
        
    }

or as a plain package routine

    package Package;

    our $VERSION = '0.01';

    use XAS::Utils ':validation';

    sub routine {
        my $p = validate_params(\@_, {
            -p1 => 1,
            -p2 => 1,
        });

        my $p1 = $p->{p1};
        my $p2 = $p->{p2};
        
    }
  
=head2 ERROR HANDLING

For the most part error handling is done thru exceptions and those exceptions
have names and those names have meaning. Those names should be lower case and
have dot (.) separators. The utility function dotid() is very handy when 
creating those names. Example:

    package Package;

    our $VERSION = '0.01';

    use Try::Tiny;
    use XAS::Class
      debug   => 0,
      version => $VERSION,
      base    => 'XAS::Base',
      utils   => ':validation dotid',
   ;

   sub routine {
       my $self = shift;
       my ($p1, $p2) = validate_params(\@_, [1,1]);

      try {

          If ($p1 == $p2) {

              do_something();

          } else {

              $self->throw_msg(
                  dotid($self->class) . '.routine.notequal',
                  'notequal',
                  $p1, $p2
              );

          }

      } catch {

          my $ex = $_;

          $self->exception_handler($ex);

      };

   }

   1;

The name of this exception would be 'package.routine.notequal' were 'notequal'
would be the exception type. The message for this exception is 'notequal' and
would have the format of "%s is not equal to %s". This is a quick and easy way
to find problems in your code.

=head1 COMMENTS

I don't believe in excessive comments. They clutter the code and are 
usually wrong. Comments should only be used when something out of the ordinary
is about to happen. Otherwise the actual code should be sufficient. It's all
that white space and indenting, it really works.

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

Documentation is good. It should be at the end of the file after the code. I 
find POD intertwined with the code to be hard to read. And please run the
documentation thru a spell checker. 

=head1 TEMPLATES

There are several templates provided to help write code. Use them, they are 
boiler plate, where you just fill in the blanks and start coding.
