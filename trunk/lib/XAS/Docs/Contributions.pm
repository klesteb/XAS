XAS::Docs::Contributions - How to contribute to XAS

So you have used the code base and like what you saw and want to contribute 
back. For that, thanks. Contributions are gladly accepted when they follow
the below guide lines.

=head1 CODE

All contributed code must be licensed under the Perl license, v5.8.8 or 
later, at your leisure. Even thou the current trend is to have a separate 
license for contributions, I feel that this is sufficient protection for all 
involved.

Your code must have an author and copyright/license attributions, like the 
ones on the bottom of this document. That way we know who contributed the 
code.

=head1 DOCUMENTATION

I will gladly accept documentation. You can never have enough, but all 
contributed documentation must be licensed under the same terms as code 
contributions. 

=head1 MONEY

I will gladly accept money contributions. You can donate thru Paypal. My email
is below.
