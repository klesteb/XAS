XAS::Docs::Contributions - How to contribute to XAS

So you have used the framework and liked what you saw and want to contribute 
back. For that, thanks. Contributions are gladly accepted when they follow
the below guide lines.

=head1 CONTRIBUTIONS

All contributed code, documentation and patches will be licensed under the 
Perl v5.8.8 or later license, just like the rest of the code base. This is
known as the L<"inbound=outbound"|http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2014/06/09/do-not-need-cla.html>
principle. 

Additionally, any contributed modules, code or documentation, must have an author
and copyright/license attributions, like the ones at the bottom of this 
document. That way, I know who contributed what.

=head1 DONATIONS

I will gladly accept money donations. You can donate thru L<PayPal|https://www.paypal.com/home>. My email
is in the code. The donation doesn't obligate me in any way or fashion to
provide a service. Please use the "Friends and Family" option when sending the
donation.
