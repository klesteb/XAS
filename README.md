I have over 30 years in systems administration. During those years, I
have written or help maintain 4 operations environments. Most where on
proprietery platforms that can't be reproduced nor released. This one is 
a generic version of the 6th iteration of the 4th environemnt. 

These are the base modules that make up the system. They represent a
"best practice" on how to write distributed systems in Perl. 

These modules use a standardized way tp write applications, handle
command line parameters, run background processes and pass data thru 
the system in a consistent and reliable fashion. They are portable, the 
applications run on Windows as well as *nix flavors, this includes the
background processes. This was designed in from the beginning and not as 
an after thought. 

Enjoy...
